# Football Standings ETL Pipeline âš½ðŸ“Š

This project demonstrates how to design and implement a simple **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline** for football data. The pipeline automates the process of fetching football standings from the [Football-Data API](https://api.football-data.org/v4/competitions/PD/standings/), cleaning and transforming the data, and finally loading it into a **PostgreSQL** database for storage and further analysis.

## ðŸ”¹ Project Workflow

1. **Extract**  
   - Data is retrieved from the `https://api.football-data.org/v4/competitions/PD/standings/` endpoint (La Liga standings).  
   - API authentication is handled using an access token.  

2. **Transform (Clean)**  
   - Unnecessary fields are dropped.  
   - Column names are standardized for readability.  
   - Data is structured into a clean tabular format suitable for a relational database.  

3. **Load**  
   - The transformed data is inserted into a **PostgreSQL** database.  
   - SQLModel/psycopg2 is used for database connection and table creation (if not existing).

## ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

- **Python** (scripting & data handling)  
- **Requests** (API calls)  
- **Pandas** (data cleaning and transformation)  
- **SQLModel / psycopg2** (PostgreSQL integration)  
- **PostgreSQL** (database storage)

## ðŸ”¹ Use Cases

- Automating football data collection for analytics and reporting.  
- Building dashboards to track standings in real-time.  
- Demonstrating practical ETL skills for data engineering workflows.
